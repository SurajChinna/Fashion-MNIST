<h1>Fashion MNIST using Pytorch</h1>
<h2>About Project:</h2>
<p>
  The project is about classifying the images in the Fashion MNIST dataset which contains 28x28 grayscale images with 10 labels. There 
  are 60,000 images in training set and 10,000 images in testing set. The model in two notebooks are built using the basic 
  neural networks and not Convolutional neural networks yet it gives accuracy more than 88% on the testing set. In the notebook, 
  <b>Fashion MNIST.ipynb</b> you could see that after some epochs the model starts overfitting. This is where <b>Fashion MNIST Dropout</b> 
  comes in. This notebook uses Dropout layer that helps in preventing overfitting.
